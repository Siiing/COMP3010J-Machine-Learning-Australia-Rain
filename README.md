# COMP3010J-Machine-Learning-Australia-Rain

This project aims to address the challenge of weather prediction by developing machine learning models to forecast whether it will rain the next day in Australia. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset comprising approximately 10 years of daily meteorological observations from multiple locations across Australia, this study explores the application of various classification algorithms for binary weather prediction.


The dataset comprises approximately 10 years of daily weather observations collected from numerous locations across Australia by the Bureau of Meteorology.

**Feature Categories**:
- Temperature metrics (MinTemp, MaxTemp, Temp9am, Temp3pm)
- Precipitation data (Rainfall, RainToday)
- Atmospheric conditions (Pressure, Humidity, Cloud-cover)
- Wind measurements (Speed, Direction at different times)
- Evaporation and Sunshine records
- Location and temporal information

**Target Variable**: 
- RainTomorrow (Yes/No), the definition is the rainfall on the second day is greater than 1mm.
